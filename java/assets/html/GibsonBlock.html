GIBSON BLOCK
9608 JASPER AVENUE

Description of Historic Place The Gibson Block, also known as the Flat iron building, is large wedgeshaped four-storey brick building constructed for commercial use at the eastern edge of Edmonton's pre-WWI commercial core. Heritage Value The Gibson Block is valued as a rare example of a commercial building following the 1902 prototype of a flat iron building, so named for its distinctive triangular shape. The building design, with Chicago style influences, balances the vertical emphasis of pilasters and windows with the horizontal presentation of the continuous glass shop fronts and first storey and fourth storey cornices. Developed by William Gibson, the Gibson Block characterizes the historic wave of prosperity and opportunity at the height of the commercial boom in pre-WWI Edmonton. Originally built to provide first floor retail space and offices on the remaining floors, the building's use has evolved with Edmonton's changing economic fortunes and has included office, retail and for a significant part of the historic period, the well known Turkish Baths, which closed in 1978. The Gibson Block's triangular form and prominent location on Jasper Avenue contribute to its valued local landmark status.

Character Defining Elements - massing and form of the building, in particular the triangular shape; - Chicago style influences such as: the brick bays, the continuous glass shop front at street level and the entablatures and cornices on the first level and at top of the building; - design elements such as the decorative square motif in brick and concrete, the restored amethyst prism glass, the cornice medallions, the stairwell windows on the north façade, including the fourth storey brick semicircular arch;

- the curved windows at the toe of the wedged shaped building; - the south façade semicircular wooden archway main entrance with keystone design, including the doors and globe lights; - recessed storefront entrances and ceramic tiles on the south façade; - the sash window openings, one over one, with cast stone sills.
