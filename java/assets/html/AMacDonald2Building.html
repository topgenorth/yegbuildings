<H1>A. MacDONALD BUILDING</H1>
10128 - 105 AVENUE
<H2>Description of Historic Place</h2>

<p>The A. Macdonald Building is a solid four storey rectangular pre-WWI brick warehouse. It is located on a corner lot, just north of the former CNR rightof-way that defined the northern edge of Edmonton's
    historic downtown core. Heritage Value The A. Macdonald Building is historically significant for the role it played
    in the history of the storage and cartage of wholesale grocery goods in Edmonton to the mid-twentieth century. It was
    constructed in 1913 and named for Alexander Macdonald, president of the A. Macdonald Company of Winnipeg, whose
    Edmonton
    branch became one of the three largest grocery suppliers in northern Alberta. The A. Macdonald Building has an
    historical association with four significant inter-related firms, the A. Macdonald Company; H. H. Cooper and
    Company;
    Macdonald-Cooper Ltd., and Macdonald's Consolidated Limited. Macdonald Consolidated Limited had become a subsidiary
    of
    Canada Safeway Limited, when the warehouse was vacated in 1965. The A. Macdonald Building is also associated with
    Harry
    H. Cooper, a leading member of Edmonton's business community, and who was associated with each of the companies that
    occupied the A. MacDonald Building.</p>

<p>The A. Macdonald Building is of architectural significance as one of Edmonton's most distinguished examples of
    commercial warehouse architecture. A landmark in the Central McDougall area, the A. Macdonald Building retains a
    high
    level of integrity of design and historic fabric, as well as a strong relationship to its site. The building is
    missing
    its upper cornice detailing. </p>
