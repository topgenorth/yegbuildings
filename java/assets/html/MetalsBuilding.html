METALS LIMITED BUILDING
10190 - 104 STREET
Description of Historic Place The Metals Building is a rectangular three storey brick rectangular warehouse with a distinctive chamfered entrance façade located on a rectangular corner lot in the heart of the pre-WWI warehouse district. Heritage Value This warehouse built in 1914 to house a plumbing wholesale supply business is important as representative of Edmonton's emerging role as "gateway to the north" and the pre-WWI era economic boom. It is equally significant for its association with leading entrepreneurs of that era including owner William Roper Hull, an industrialist, real estate and meat packing entrepreneur who established the Gurney Standard Metal Company Limited in 1910 which later became Metals Ltd. The Metals Ltd. Board of Directors included A. E. Cross, James Loughheed and R. B. Bennett, all prominent in Alberta's business and public life. Metals Ltd. and its successor companies occupied the building until 1954. The Metals Building was designed by Magoon and MacDonald, a well known Edmonton architectural firm, who also designed Old St. Stephens College, McDougall Methodist Church and the Public Library. Herbert Alton Magoon (1863-1941) designs were influenced by his Chicago architectural training. George Heath Macdonald (18831961) worked originally as draftsman for Magoon and later returned to school and qualified as an architect and Magoon's partner. The Metals Building displays the competent design approach of Magoon and Macdonald including balanced chamfered entrance way with tripartite second and third floor windows, cast stone belt coursing, regular patterns of bays and windows and functional expression of façade for stairways and utility rooms. Character Defining Elements The form and massing of the building including the design and materials of the principal elevations such as: - chamfered façade entrance with pairs of double hung windows on the second and third levels; - strong solid base plinth with cast stone sill course banding at first floor; - rhythm of windows in the recessed bays between brick pilasters; - corbelled brick dentils and metal cornice; - jack knife doors with steel flat plate below each door; - cast stone panel above the door "METALS LTD. ERECTED 1914"; - two rose and leaf deigns cast in stone on either side of the door entrance; - timber door entrance, transom and sidelights; - original painted parapet signs; - circular opening or plate at basement level westerly end; - the expression of functional relationships through window placement, in particular the interior stairwell.
