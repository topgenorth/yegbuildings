<h1>ARLINGTON APARTMENTS</h1>
10524 - 100 AVENUE
<h2>Description of Historic Place</h2>

<p>The Arlington Apartments, a rectangular five-storey brick pre-WWI apartment block, is located close to Edmonton's
    downtown core on 100 Avenue.

<h2>Heritage Value</h2>
The Arlington Apartments is significant as it characterizes Edmonton's
rapid growth in population and consequent demand for accommodation during the pre-WWI economic boom. Built in
response to the need for downtown accommodation, a function it continues to serve today, the Arlington Apartments
addressed the aspirations of an emerging professional and managerial class by providing centrally located and
attractive modern accommodation. Important for its construction technique as well as its design, the Arlington
Apartments were rapidly constructed in 1909 with load bearing masonry walls and marked the initial introduction to
Edmonton of the apartment block as a distinct building type. Its simple well-proportioned design and modest
classical detailing is reminiscent of the Edwardian era.
