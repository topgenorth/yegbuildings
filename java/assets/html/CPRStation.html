CPR STATION
8101 - GATEWAY BOULEVARD

Description of Historic Place The Strathcona Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) Station consists of a one and one-half storey building with a two-storey projecting polygonal tower. The station is located east of 103 Street and south of 82 (Whyte) Avenue in the historic district of Old Strathcona in the south of Edmonton. Heritage Value The Strathcona CPR Station is valued for its association with the Canadian Pacific Railway and the early railways that helped to form Strathcona as a city prior to amalgamation with Edmonton in 1913. Strathcona was the northern most terminus for the Calgary and Edmonton (C&E) Railway later to become the CPR. Known as the `end of steel', it was the point at which the railways could extend no further without building massive bridges over the North Saskatchewan River Valley. Strathcona grew in importance as the end of the line and a major transportation and transhipment point in, and to, Northern Alberta. The station remained in active railway use until 1980. The Station is also valued as an indicator of the importance of rail travel early in the Twentieth Century. Prior to the extensive network of highways that currently connects the Province, the primary mode of transportation and shipment was by rail. Important connections between Calgary and Edmonton helped the province's two largest cities form and allowed access to business opportunities, government and family in each city as well as other smaller centres around the Province. The station is significant for its architecture as evidenced by the same design being used for three subsequent Alberta CPR stations at Lethbridge, Red deer, and Medicine Hat. Built with elements of Classical and Renaissance Revival architecture, this Edwardian-era station is massed in a long horizontal fashion along the rail tracks to maximize coverage of the platform serving arriving and departing trains. A massive roof, with large support brackets overhangs the platform to shelter passengers from the elements. Additionally, the tower affords the structure a prominent silhouette and makes it immediately recognizable. Character Defining Elements The Classical and Renaissance Revival architecture of the building is expressed in character-defining elements such as: - form, scale and massing; - bellcast hipped roof with oversized eave brackets; - asymmetrical position of top storey and tower; - masonry construction including brick facing with Tyndall stone details; - polygonal tower on platform side of building; - doors opening onto platform area; - smooth Tyndall stone window sills and tower cladding; - paired stone brackets, dentil course, rusticated pilasters and keystones on tower; - smooth Tyndall stone corner quoining; - rough Tyndall stone foundation.
