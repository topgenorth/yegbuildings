<h1>CECIL S. BURGESS RESIDENCE</h1>
10958 - 89 AVENUE
<h2>Description of Historic Place</h2>
The Cecil Burgess Residence consists of a two storey, wood-frame residential building on a
corner lot in the historic Garneau neighbourhood adjacent to the University of Alberta campus. Heritage Value The Cecil
Burgess Residence is significant because of its association with architect and teacher Cecil Burgess (1870-1971), who
became the University of Alberta resident architect in 1913 and designed many early campus buildings. Burgess ran a
school of architecture during the 1930's and retired in 1940 to enter private architectural and town planning practice
until his death in 1971. He purchased this house in 1942. While University architect, he designed Pembina Hall, a
student residence, and the staff houses on campus circle. He was perhaps best known for his town planning work and his
promotion of the 'Town Beautiful' movement in Alberta. As an architect, he was better known as an associate of Nobbs and
Hyde in Edmonton. He prepared town plans for the townsites of Jasper, Banff, Lethbridge and Medicine Hat. The Cecil
Burgess Residence is also significant because of its architecture, built in c. 1912, which is an excellent vernacular
example of the Craftsman Style, a North American adaptation of the British Arts and Crafts style. The Cecil Burgess
Residence is also significant because of its association with the development of the Garneau community, one of south
Edmonton's oldest settled neighbourhoods dating from before
WWI. This community was built in association with, and adjacent to, the University of Alberta. The community served
University employees, affluent business people and civil servants who worked nearby and across the river in the downtown
Legislature community, which was connected to Garneau by the 1912 High Level Bridge.
