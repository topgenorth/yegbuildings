CANADIAN CONSOLIDATED RUBBER COMPANY WAREHOUSE
10249 - 104 STREET

Description of Historic Place The Canadian Consolidated Rubber Company building is a rectangular, red brick, five and one-half storey commercial warehouse located on the 104th Street in Edmonton's historic warehouse district. Heritage Value The Canadian Consolidated Rubber building is architecturally significant as a representative example of a commercial warehouse building that characterized Edmonton's growth during the pre-WWI economic boom. Built in 1913 on the original foundation of the Kerr Building, which was destroyed by fire in 1912 with the loss of three lives, the Canadian Consolidated Rubber Company building incorporated the most up to date fire proofing technology of the day. The historical significance of the building lies in its long association with The Canadian Consolidated Rubber Company, which owned and occupied the building from 1913 to 1935 as representative of similar companies active in the warehouse district and its continued use as a warehouse well into the 1970s.

Character Defining Elements The colour, height, massing, texture, and number of detail elements of the building relates positively to the other buildings in the warehouse district making it an important contributor to the architectural and historical character of the area. The commercial warehouse architecture of the Canadian Consolidated Rubber Building is expressed in character defining elements such as: - the original 1913 west façade including, full height pilasters capped with cast stone features, brick corbelling, dentils and parapet cornice;

- window treatment at the centrally located staircase on the west façade; - the rusticated two-storey frontispiece with cornice, projecting brick detailing and brick brackets and cornice above doorway; - patterns of fenestration, window openings, cast stone windowsills and lintels; - building date plaque; - painted ghost signs on side walls.
