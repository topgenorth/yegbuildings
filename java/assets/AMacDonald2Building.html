A. MacDONALD BUILDING
10128 - 105 AVENUE
Description of Historic Place The A. Macdonald Building is a solid four­storey rectangular pre-WWI brick warehouse. It is located on a corner lot, just north of the former CNR rightof-way that defined the northern edge of Edmonton's historic downtown core. Heritage Value The A. Macdonald Building is historically significant for the role it played in the history of the storage and cartage of wholesale grocery goods in Edmonton to the mid­twentieth century. It was constructed in 1913 and named for Alexander Macdonald, president of the A. Macdonald Company of Winnipeg, whose Edmonton branch became one of the three largest grocery suppliers in northern Alberta. The A. Macdonald Building has an historical association with four significant inter-related firms, the A. Macdonald Company; H. H. Cooper and Company; Macdonald-Cooper Ltd., and Macdonald's Consolidated Limited. Macdonald Consolidated Limited had become a subsidiary of Canada Safeway Limited, when the warehouse was vacated in 1965. The A. Macdonald Building is also associated with Harry H. Cooper, a leading member of Edmonton's business community, and who was associated with each of the companies that occupied the A. MacDonald Building.

The A. Macdonald Building is of architectural significance as one of Edmonton's most distinguished examples of commercial warehouse architecture. A landmark in the Central McDougall area, the A. Macdonald Building retains a high level of integrity of design and historic fabric, as well as a strong relationship to its site. The building is missing its upper cornice detailing. Character Defining Elements - form and massing exemplified by its rectangular shape and four storeys; - the design of the building expressed on the two principal elevations including original articulation of the hard red brick walls on the south and west façades that include piers and recessed spandrels, brick corbels, and decorative diamond shaped stonework;

- patterns of fenestration and the rhythm of the structural openings on each façade; - detailing of four ground floor arched entrance-loading docks with double loading doors above grade on the west façade, and which illustrate the original storage function of the building; - classical entablature and paired rusticated pilasters flanking the main entrance; - painted ghost wall signage identifying the corporate occupancy and function of the building on the east and north façades; - parapet and roof flag pole over the south façade; - building name plaque above the main entrance.
