YEG Historical Buildings

This is just a little Android application that show some historical buildings in Edmonton.  Thanks
to the City of Edmonton for their Open Data catalogue.  Now, only if YEG would get rid of the stupid PDF's 
that explain the buildings, and use something more mobile friendly.  HTML comes to mind.
