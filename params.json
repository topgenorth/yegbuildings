This app utilizes the City of [Edmonton's Open Data](http://data.edmonton.ca) feed for [historical buildings](http://data.edmonton.ca/Facilities-and-Structures/Historical-Buildings/prfy-5m97) as the underlying source for the buildings.  Hopefully in the future other sources of information can be utilized.\r\n\r\n## Google maps\r\n\r\nThe default.keystore I use for development is in the util directory.\r\n\r\n    keytool -list -alias androiddebugkey -keystore debug.keystore -storepass android -keypass android\r\n    androiddebugkey, Nov 3, 2011, PrivateKeyEntry, \r\n    Certificate fingerprint (MD5): 1F:98:26:DF:F3:A5:B9:AD:0E:92:28:9B:00:82:D7:11\r\n\r\nHere is the Android Maps API key for this development / debugging keystore: \r\n  \r\n    0U7qxP9sDmYSOxxQFKVQjWOn9XDSARAhf5Ouy3A\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Tom Opgenorth](http://www.opgenorth.net)\r\n\r\nTwitter: [@topgenorth](http://www.twitter.com/topgenorth)\r\n\r\n## Locations for Testing\r\nIf you want to set the emulator to a given location (for testing), here are some points around Edmonton:\r\n\r\n* Intersection of 100 Ave & 105 Street: 53.538860 -113.501118\r\n* 109 Street & Jasper Ave 53.541111 -113.508838\r\n* Jasper ave & 101 Street : 53.54270 -113.49332\r\n* The Cenotaph in front of City Hall: 53.544643 -113.49006","tagline":"A little Android application using the Open Data catalogue from the City of Edmonton","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
