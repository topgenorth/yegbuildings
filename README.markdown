# YEG Buildings

## About
This is just a simple little Android application to show the various historical buildings in the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This app utilizes the City of [Edmonton's Open Data](http://data.edmonton.ca) feed for [historical buildings](http://data.edmonton.ca/Facilities-and-Structures/Historical-Buildings/prfy-5m97).  Hopefully in the future other sources of information can be utilized.
