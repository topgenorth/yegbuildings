PARKVIEW APARTMENTS
10612 - 97 AVENUE
Description of Historic Place The Parkview Apartments is a three-storey Edwardian-era brick apartment block located on the north side of 97 Avenue adjacent to the Alberta Legislature grounds. Heritage Value The Parkview Apartments has significance as an indicator of the rapid urban growth and development of Edmonton after 1900. It has value as the first apartment building built in the river flats area along what became known as 97 Avenue in 1914. It is an important example of the accommodation which professional people and members of the increasing service and sales industry required. The Parkview Apartments is also a significant example of the Edwardian-era architecture that marked Edmonton's emergence as a centre for government and signaled the social transformation of this area. Located near the legislature grounds and building, the Parkview Apartments was an elegant building attracting middle class tenants wanting to associate with Edmonton's position as the provincial capital. The Parkview Apartments is also significant because of its association with Purcell and Foote, noted Edmonton designers and builders. Richard Foote, who constructed the adjacent Foote House in 1907, was representative of many people

important in the early era of the construction industry. With partner Nathaniel Purcell, they built a substantial contracting business, eventually designing and building important structures such as Edmonton's first Civic Block. Foote served on City Council and worked for the City Architect's Department later in his life. The Parkview Apartments has further significance because of its association with prominent Edmontonian John Kenwood, director of the Edmonton Exhibition Association and founder of Kenwood and Candy, a real estate firm that dealt in some of the earliest city properties. He was co-owner with Frank Kentwood of the Parkview from 1920 to 1962.
