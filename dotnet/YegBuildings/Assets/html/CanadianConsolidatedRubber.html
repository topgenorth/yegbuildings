<h1>CANADIAN CONSOLIDATED RUBBER COMPANY WAREHOUSE</h1>
10249 - 104 STREET

<h2>Description of Historic</h2>
Place The Canadian Consolidated Rubber Company building is a rectangular, red brick, five and
one-half storey commercial warehouse located on the 104th Street in Edmonton's historic warehouse district. Heritage
Value The Canadian Consolidated Rubber building is architecturally significant as a representative example of a
commercial warehouse building that characterized Edmonton's growth during the pre-WWI economic boom. Built in 1913 on
the original foundation of the Kerr Building, which was destroyed by fire in 1912 with the loss of three lives, the
Canadian Consolidated Rubber Company building incorporated the most up to date fire proofing technology of the day. The
historical significance of the building lies in its long association with The Canadian Consolidated Rubber Company,
which owned and occupied the building from 1913 to 1935 as representative of similar companies active in the warehouse
district and its continued use as a warehouse well into the 1970s.

<h2>Character Defining Elements</h2>
The colour, height, massing, texture, and number of detail elements of the building relates
positively to the other buildings in the warehouse district making it an important contributor to the architectural and
historical character of the area. The commercial warehouse architecture of the Canadian Consolidated Rubber Building is
