PENDENNIS HOTEL
9660-9664 JASPER AVENUE

Description of Historic Place The Pendennis Hotel consists of a three-storey brick mixed use building in a mid-block location on the north side of Jasper Avenue in the Boyle Community that was the centre of Edmonton's pre-WWI downtown. Heritage Value The Pendennis Hotel is significant for its association with the early development of Edmonton's civic core and the Boyle community, one of Edmonton's older settled neighbourhoods. It is one of a collection of surviving, important Jasper Avenue buildings associated with Edmonton's early social and commercial life. It was converted to apartments in the 1920s after prohibition laws came into effect. The Pendennis Hotel is also significant because of its architecture, which is a prominent example of an Edwardian-era combination of ground floor commercial and upper level residential functions. The building displays high quality materials and superior design in the construction of its main façade. The Pendennis Hotel is also significant because of its association with the Calgary architectural firm Lang, Major and Company, a Calgary-based partnership established in 1911. They designed many prominent civic and commercial buildings in Calgary.

Character Defining Elements The Edwardian-era architecture of the building is expressed in character defining elements such as: - form, scale and massing; - regular fenestration, including two rows of wood double-hung windows at the second and third floor levels on the front, east side and rear elevations; - two, main floor wood-framed, glazed storefronts with smallpaned, prism glass transoms; - red pressed-brick façade construction with cast stone pilasters, horizontal bands and decorative features including swags in the pilaster capitals; - red pressed-brick east side and rear elevations; - three symmetrically-located entrances, the central doubleentrance with fanlight above;

- elevated parapet and modestly projecting central and end bays on the front façade; - upper pressed-metal cornice and sign band that extends the full width of the building with central, arched pediment and large, end consoles; - lower pressed-metal cornice and sign band that extends the full width of the building terminated by small volutes; - a large, painted sign on the east wall.
