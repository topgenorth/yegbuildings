City of Edmonton Historic Resource Management Program

<h1>CHURCHILL WIRE CENTRE</h1>
10003 - 102 AVENUE

<h2>Description of Historic Place</h2>
The Churchill Wire Centre is a two-and-one-half storey granite and terrazzo clad structure with basement,
raised main floor and a four-storey addition to the west located on a prominent corner lot in Edmonton's civic
district.
<h2>Heritage Value</h2>

<p>The Churchill Wire Centre, constructed in 1947, is significant because it is an excellent and rare surviving
    local
    example of the Stripped Classicism style of architecture, a subset of the Moderne style. Its human scale,
    geometric
    and subtle classical references and early use of prefabricated exterior components helped influence the design
    of
    successive commercial and civic structures surrounding Churchill Square. Its modernistic styling is also
    symbolic
    of the changing attitudes towards new technologies and non-traditional design that became the hallmark of later
    twentieth century architecture. The Churchill Wire Centre is also significant because of its association with
    Edmonton's former city architect, Maxwell Dewar, who oversaw the design of this building. He designed several
    civic
    buildings during Edmonton's period of rapid growth after WWII, when oil was discovered at Leduc in 1947. Dewar
    also planned the civic development around adjacent Sir Winston Churchill Square.</p>

<p>The Churchill Wire Centre is also significant because of its original function as an urban industrial building.
    It had an open plan interior and tall ceilings to accommodate bulky long-distance switching equipment on the
    upper
    floor. The sculptural program includes a figure above the main entrance, reminiscent of the Greek god Mercury,
    holding cables and lightning bolts. Two telephone booths flanking the main interior staircase are also
    reminders of the building's original function. The Churchill Wire Centre is also significant because it played
    a central role in the history of Edmonton's former municipal telephone company, Edmonton Telephones. The
    company experienced significant growth in the 1940s, necessitating the addition of a larger headquarters to
    its 1922 Municipal Telephone System building on an adjacent lot to the west. A four-storey addition in 1958,
    extending the north facade of the earlier portion to the sidewalk, provided yet more room. The Churchill Wire
    Centre continued in operation until 1984.
