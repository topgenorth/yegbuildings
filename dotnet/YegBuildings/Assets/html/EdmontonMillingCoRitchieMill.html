<h1>EDMONTON MILLING CO. (RITCHIE MILL)</h1>
10170 - SASKATCHEWAN DRIVE

<h2>Description of Historic Place</h2>
The Ritchie Mill is a visually prominent structure consisting of several building segments that are between two and
four storeys in height and is located on the south escarpment of the North Saskatchewan River valley, facing across
the North Saskatchewan River to the historical Edmonton core. Heritage Value Constructed in 1892 and the oldest
surviving flour mill in the Province, the Ritchie Mill is significant because of its association with the early
agricultural and industrial development of Alberta. It is associated with early technical innovation, using steam
powered, steel rollers instead of the traditional stone wheels that became pitted when grinding hard prairie wheat.
The Ritchie Mill is also significant because of its association with industrial and agricultural development in an
urban setting and with the development of the Strathcona community, one of south Edmonton's oldest settled
neighbourhoods, dating from the arrival of the Calgary and Edmonton railway in 1892, which terminated at the North
Saskatchewan River Valley. The Ritchie Mill was located at the 'End of Steel' to take advantage of the rail link with
the southern part of the Province. Elevators were added in 1895 and 1902 and the building functioned as a flour mill
until 1948. The Ritchie Mill is also significant because of its association with Robert Ritchie who arrived in
Strathcona in 1892. Within a year he had built and began operating the flour mill and added elevators in 1895 and
1905. Ritchie also served in local politics as alderman, school trustee, justice of the peace and in 1906 as mayor of
Strathcona. The Ritchie Mill is also significant as a prominent visual landmark on the south edge of the North
Saskatchewan River Valley. Its tall profile was readily visible from Edmonton across the river valley and as a landmark
signified the end of the Calgary and Edmonton railway line in Strathcona.
