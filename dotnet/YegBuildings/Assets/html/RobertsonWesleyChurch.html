Wesley United Church, originally a Methodist congregation that had been active in the West End since 1907. The monumental scale and high style of the church reflected the wealth and influence of the original congregation, as well as their community spirit and optimism for the further development of Edmonton's original 'West End.' The later addition of the Memorial Chapel and Hall, started in 1950 and dedicated in 1955, commemorated the dead from both world wars. Completed in 1914, the church is an excellent example of the Gothic Revival style.

When the congregations were united in 1971, the memorial Robertson-Wesley United Church was designed by architect D.S. McIlroy of Calgary, who was responsible for a number of Gothic Revival style churches in Alberta, including the First Baptist Church (1911-12) in Calgary and St. Paul's Presbyterian (1930) in Banff. The Memorial Hall and Chapel were designed by G.H.
