NORTH
TELEPHONE
EXCHANGE
10105 - 112 AVENUE
Description of Historic Place
The former North Telephone
Exchange Building is an Edwardianera two-storey rectangular masonry
structure on a prominent corner
lot in a primarily residential
neighbourhood north of downtown
Edmonton.
Heritage Value
The North Telephone Exchange
derives historical importance from
its close association with the rapid
growth of Edmonton prior to WWI
and its long use as a civic building.
A marker of Edmonton’s booming
economic situation, the structure is
significant as evidence of the
optimism of the time and the
growing demand for telephone
service outside of the downtown, in
particular in the residential market
prior to WWI. The building remained
in its original use until 1958.
The North Telephone Exchange is
also valued for its association with
prominent Alberta architect Allen
Merrick Jeffers. Jeffers had designed
several public buildings as Alberta’s
Provincial Architect from 1907 to
1912, and is particularly significant
for designing the Alberta Legislature.
He was also Edmonton’s City
Architect from 1912 to 1914. This
classically-inspired Edwardian-era
structure was characteristic of Jeffers’
style and training.
The Edwardian-era neo-classical
styling of the building is modest as

befits an industrial structure, yet
massed and scaled to be prominent
in the growing neighbourhood. Its
strong symmetry and regular
fenestration convey a sense of
strength and permanence while its
emphasis on verticality with
horizontal banding further add to
its sophistication as a carefully-styled
building. The North Telephone
Exchange’s open interior layout and
upper loading dock enabled the city
to further expand telephone
operations from this building. Large
double-hung wooden windows
allowed natural light to enter and
provided ventilation for operators
and equipment.
The North Telephone exchange is
significance as a landmark among
its mainly working-class residential
neighbourhood. Its imposing
appearance and location make it
stand out among the surrounding
single-family residences of the area.
