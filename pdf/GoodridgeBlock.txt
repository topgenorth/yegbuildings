GOODRIDGE
BUILDING
9696-9698 - JASPER
AVENUE
Description of Historic Place
The Goodridge Block is a rectangular,
three–storey brick Edwardian style
commercial building. Located on a
corner lot at the intersection of
97 Street and Jasper Avenue, it
anchors the historic East Jasper
district in the City of Edmonton.
Heritage Value
The Goodridge Block is historically
significant as a mixed-use retail and
office block developed by Leonard
Goodridge in the heart of
Edmonton’s business district at the
height of the pre-WWI economic
boom. The Goodridge Block has a
strong historical association with the
hardware business beginning with
the opening of W.W. Sales in 1930
under the direction of S.P. Wilson.
The business name W.W. Arcade,
which has sentimental associations
for generations of Edmontonians,
was adopted in 1942 when the
Ainslie Brothers took over the
business, and was continued by the
Imperial Lumber Company, from
1980 until its closure in 1989.
The Goodridge Block, constructed
between 1911 and 1912, is
architecturally significant as a
representative example of classical
tradition in commercial architecture.
Well-known Edmonton architect
Robert Percy Barnes (1859–1926),
generally credited with founding the
Alberta Association of Architects in
1906, designed the Goodridge
Block.
