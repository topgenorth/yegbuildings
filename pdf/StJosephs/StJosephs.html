ST JOSEPH'S AUXILLIARY HOSPITAL
10722 - 82 AVENUE
Description of Historic Place The refurbished St. Joseph's Hospital is now a condominium development known as The Garneau. The seven story red brick building with limestone detailing and projecting central frontispiece is the culmination of several well-conceived additions. The largest building on the street, it occupies twelve city lots and is a significant landmark in Edmonton's historic Old Strathcona. Heritage Value St. Joseph's Hospital is historically significant for its association with the Sisters of Providence of St. Vincent de Paul of the Roman Catholic Church who have provided nursing care on this site since 1929. In 1948 the newly built St. Joseph's Hospital opened its doors as a 150 bed modern facility for the care of the chronically ill. St. Joseph's Hospital was also important as the first hospital to treat the victims of the 1948 poliomyelitis epidemic. The epidemic created the need for additional chronic care beds that was addressed by the addition of the fifth and sixth floors in 1955. St. Joseph's Hospital became an auxiliary hospital for extended care in the late 1950s, and finally closed in 1993. St. Joseph's Hospital is architecturally significant as an early example of modernist architecture in Edmonton. Designed by prominent Edmonton architect George Heath Macdonald (1882­1961), who was responsible for many of the City's important buildings. St. Joseph's Hospital's modernist design combines an austere façade with a rigid symmetry that incorporates Art Deco and International Style decorative elements, while its projecting central and end pavilions are associated with a Beaux­Arts plan shape. St. Joseph's Hospital is architecturally significant as an early example of modernist architecture in Edmonton. Although originally designed as a six-story building by prominent Edmonton architect George Heath Macdonald (1882­1961), only four storeys were built at the time. St. Joseph's Hospital's modernist design combines an austere façade with a rigid symmetry that incorporates Art Deco and International Style decorative elements. Character Defining Elements The original design of St. Joseph's hospital is exemplified in character defining elements such as: - the blend of brick and limestone detailing on the six-storey central pavilion frontispiece, with main entrance, exterior stairway with two original lanterns flanked by blind lancet openings and Art Deco incised chevrons; - the six-storey portion of the four façades; - all remaining portions of the three limestone upper cornices; - rhythm and patterns of all original fenestration including: the Gothic window with quatrefoil on west side of chapel, the pair of Gothic windows each containing 11 lights with diamond leading on the east side of chapel, and all International Style glass block windows; - all other limestone detailing such as windowsills and additional chevrons.
