RICHARD WALLACE
RESIDENCE
10950 - 81 STREET
Description of Historic Place
The Richard Wallace Residence, a
rectangular one and a half storey
house with a gable roof and open
front porch, was constructed in the
craftsman style in 1923. It is located
on a quiet tree-lined street in the
mature neighbourhood of Cromdale
in the City of Edmonton.
Heritage Value
The Richard Wallace Residence is
architecturally significant as a
representative example of a modest
house in the Craftsman style, popular
in Edmonton in the 1920s, which
retains full integrity of historic design
and fabric.
The Richard Wallace Residence is
so-named for its long historical
association with the second owner
of the house, Richard Wallace.
Wallace, who was registrar, sheriff
and clerk of Alberta’s Supreme Court,
resided here from 1925 to 1943.
The house has been maintained as
a single-family dwelling and adds to
the historic character of the
streetscape.
