CHILDRENS’
SHELTER/ROSS
FLATS APARTMENTS
9540 - 101 STREET
Description of Historic Place
The Ross Flats Apartments is a
classically-inspired three and onehalf storey Edwardian-era brick
building. It is located at the corner
of 101 Street and 98th Avenue in
the river valley area referred to as
Ross Flats.
Heritage Value
The Ross Flats Apartments is
significant because it is the earliest
surviving example of a children’s
shelter in the Edmonton Area. Built
by the City of Edmonton to replace
an earlier facility in the east end, it
became the home for ‘delinquent
and neglected children.’ As such it
stands as a record of child and social
care early in the history of the city
and province. The proportions reflect
its original institutional use and
further enhance its value as an early
example of Edwardian-era
government social facilities.
The Ross Flats Apartments is also
significant for its association with
later uses including the Salvation
Army Grace Hospital from 1925 to
1942 and as a stopping point for
American servicemen during WWII.
It is now a residential apartment
building and is significant for being
continuously owned by the City of
Edmonton since its construction.
The building is also significant for its
architecture. A particularly good
example of the Edwardian-era
Classical Revival style, this structure
displays a high level of design

sophistication and refined detailing.
Symmetrically-massed, its central
entry bay and regular façade
elements convey a formal sense of
order and institution.
The Ross Flats apartments is further
valued for its association with its
designer, architect James Henderson.
Henderson was in the height of his
career when this building was
designed and his mature style is
reflected in the careful composition
of the building. Henderson is wellknown for designing the Ernest
Brown Block and the Moser and
Ryder Building and also served as
the President of the Alberta
Association of Architects in 1914.
The Ross Flats apartments is also
significant for is association with the
early development of the river valley
community of Rossdale. One of the
oldest settled neighbourhoods in
Edmonton, Rossdale developed as
an industrial centre, close to the
downtown core, with surrounding
modest working-class residential
areas.
