McTAGGART
RESIDENCE
11530 - 95A STREET
Description of Historic Place
The McTaggart residence is a gabled
roof, rectangular bungalow, with an
enclosed front veranda. A wood
frame structure clad with wood
siding and decorative wood shingles,
it is located on a rectangular city lot
in Edmontonâ€™s mature Norwood
neighbourhood.
Heritage Value
Significant as a well-preserved
modest craftsman bungalow, the
McTaggart residence is also
representative of a middle-income
single-family dwelling of the postWWI era.
The McTaggart residence uses a
variety of decorative motifs
reminiscent of the craftsman style
such as, square posts with capitals
supporting the verandah, exposed
rafters with scrolled ends, large eave
brackets and decorative wood
shingles in the gable ends.
The house, built circa 1922, is
significant for its association with
individuals and families who made
contributions to the community
through their military and civic
participation. Built by a real-estate
developer, it was first occupied by
John Lawson Haight, a veteran of
WWI and teacher. John Wesley
McTaggart, a well-known
accountant, and his wife Myril, both
active citizens of Edmonton, bought
the house in 1925. Mrs. McTaggart
lived in the house until 1977.
