TRUDEL RESIDENCE
8134 - JASPER AVENUE

Description of Historic Place
Trudel Residence is a one-storey brick
bungalow on an irregular landscaped
lot in the Cromdale neighbourhood
east of downtown Edmonton,
overlooking the North Saskatchewan
River valley.
Heritage Value
The Trudel Residence is significant
because of its association with
Richard Palin Blakey, who designed
the building in 1928. Blakey was
Alberta’s provincial architect from
1912 to 1924 and is best
remembered for his work on the
Alberta Legislature, including the
design of its rotunda, staircase and
south block. This was one of Blakey’s
few residential commissions as a
privately practicing architect.
The Trudel Residence is also
significant because of its unique
architecture. An eclectic mixture of
styles influenced by the entre-guerre
revivals, the house is carefully
proportioned and designed to take
advantage of the sweeping views
over the Saskatchewan River Valley.
The building’s modest stature is
offset by the sophistication of its
detailing. The surrounding
landscaping, including trees and
hedges, complements the building’s
dignified character.

Edmonton’s former commercial core,
east of the present downtown, and
its attractive setting overlooking the
North Saskatchewan River valley
encouraged affluent families to settle
here prior to WWII. The residence is
recognized for its high quality of
construction and as one of the
best-preserved homes in this
neighbourhood. It remains a
prominent local landmark to
this day.
The Trudel Residence is also
significant because of its association
with Louis Trudel, the building’s
original owner who lived here until
1940. Trudel was a local furrier who
traded and manufactured fur
products for local and regional
markets. Nicknamed Edmonton’s
‘Buffalo King,’ he paid for the house
using proceeds from the sale of
buffalo coats to the RCMP.
