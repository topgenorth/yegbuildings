CHARLES BARKER RESIDENCE
10834 - 125 STREET

Description of Historic Place The Charles Barker residence, a one and one-half-storey, cedar shingled, gabled roof building, has a shed dormer and covered verandah on the front facade. The wood frame structure is clad with wood siding and is located on a city lot in Edmonton's mature Westmount area. Heritage Value The Charles Barker residence is an important architectural and historical example of a single-family dwelling with craftsman style influences built in Edmonton's Westmount area during the pre-WWI era. Stewart Hill, a developer and realtor with the South Side Realty Company, built the Charles Barker residence after 1912. The location and modest craftsman style of the house was such that it was marketed to, and was most likely occupied by, professionals or civil servants. Several individuals and families have lived there since Charles Barker first occupied the house in 1915. The Westmount area has the greatest concentration of pre-WWI single-family dwellings in Edmonton.
