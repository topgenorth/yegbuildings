GIBSON BLOCK
9608 JASPER AVENUE

Description of Historic Place
The Gibson Block, also known as the
Flat iron building, is large wedgeshaped four-storey brick building
constructed for commercial use at
the eastern edge of Edmonton’s
pre-WWI commercial core.
Heritage Value
The Gibson Block is valued as a rare
example of a commercial building
following the 1902 prototype of a
flat iron building, so named for its
distinctive triangular shape. The
building design, with Chicago style
influences, balances the vertical
emphasis of pilasters and windows
with the horizontal presentation of
the continuous glass shop fronts and
first storey and fourth storey cornices.
Developed by William Gibson, the
Gibson Block characterizes the
historic wave of prosperity and
opportunity at the height of the
commercial boom in pre-WWI
Edmonton. Originally built to
provide first floor retail space and
offices on the remaining floors, the
building’s use has evolved with
Edmonton’s changing economic
fortunes and has included office,
retail and for a significant part of the
historic period, the well known
Turkish Baths, which closed in 1978.
The Gibson Block’s triangular form
and prominent location on Jasper
Avenue contribute to its valued local
landmark status.
