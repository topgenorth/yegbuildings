APARTMENTS

Description of Historic Place
The Westminster Apartments is a
three story L-shaped brick
Edwardian apartment building. It
is located on a double corner lot
in Edmonton’s Oliver
neighbourhood.
Heritage Value
The construction of the
Westminster Apartments in 1912
by Western Canada Properties Ltd.,
is associated with speculative
investment of eastern Canadian
capital during the economic boom
in Edmonton before WWI. The
historic significance of the
Westminster Apartments lies equally
in the provision of alternative
housing in an area of
predominantly single-family
residences, and its patterns of
occupancy have been an economic
and social barometer for the
neighbourhood for over eighty
years. The Westminster Apartments
has an historical association with
C.A Brine, builder and property
manager (1912–1948) for the
Westminster Apartments Ltd.,
whose fortune allowed his wife
Margaret Hazelwood Gold Brine to
be a generous benefactor of the
arts in Edmonton after his death in
1963. The Westminster Apartments
also has a long association with the
Spillios family beginning in 1948
when George Spillios, a leader in
Edmonton’s Greek community and
proprietor of the city’s well-known
American Dairy Lunch, purchased
the building.

The architectural significance of the
Westminster Apartment Building lies
in the distinctive detailing of its
brown/red wire cut brick cladding,
the decorative use of brick patterns,
and glazed surface porcelain tiles on
its two street elevations. It is a
representative example of an elegant
pre-WWI apartment building, which
has maintained the full integrity of
its historic design and fabric.
The Westminster Apartments is a
landmark conspicuous for its
massing, finishes, and location on a
major route into downtown
Edmonton from the river valley. It
has sentimental associations for the
Oliver community, and historical
association with other apartment
blocks in the neighbourhood, most
notably the LeMarchand Mansion,
the Annamoe Mansion, the Buena
Vista Apartments, and the Derwas
Court, and symbolizes an
attachment to historic housing in
the area.
