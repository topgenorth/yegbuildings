Heritage Value
The Edmonton Drill Hall / Prince of
Wales Armouries is important for its
association with Edmonton’s military
contribution during WWI and WWII.
Its design was unique to Edmonton
and representative of Canadian
military drill hall design of the period.
Completed in 1915 for Department
of National Defense, the Edmonton
Drill Hall / Prince of Wales Armouries
is significant for its role as
Edmonton’s long-term training
facility for Canada’s armed forces
and for its contribution to the
organization, and mobilization of
Canada’s military. It became the
home of a number of prominent
regiments, such as the 51st battalion
and the 233rd French-Canadian
Battalion during WWI, later, it served
as a base for 101st Edmonton
Fusiliers, The Loyal Edmonton
Regiment and the 49th Regiment.

Originally named The Edmonton
Drill Hall, it was renamed the Prince
of Wales Armouries in 1921 and was
used as a military training site by the
Department of National Defence
until 1977.
The Edmonton Drill Hall / Prince of
Wales Armouries is significant for its

inspired design. Designed and
constructed as a part of a national
military training initiative, it is similar
to other Drill Halls designed by the
Federal Department of Public Works.
