Dr ROBERT WELLS RESIDENCE
10328 - CONNAUGHT DRIVE

Description of Historic Place The Wells Residence is an irregular plan, one-and-a-half-storey house with a detached coach house, in the Glenora neighbourhood west of downtown Edmonton. Heritage Value The Wells Residence, built in 1911, is significant as representative of houses that were built in upper class communities in Edmonton. Located in the Glenora neighbourhood, west of downtown Edmonton, this exclusive neighbourhood attracted businessmen and professionals who could afford grand homes such as this residence. This house, with its detached coach house and formal setting, is a good example of the scale and grandeur of contemporary houses built in the area. The architecture is significant for its Arts and Crafts design. Influenced by the popularity of the style in Britain, the Arts and Crafts movement was quickly adapted in Western Canada and became a prominent style in affluent residential neighbourhoods of most major cities. Typified by hand-crafted materials and irregular massing, the Wells residence is an excellent example of the style. The Wells Residence is also significant because of its association with its former owner, Dr. Robert B. Wells, a professor of Ophthalmology and respected eye surgeon, he was also

known as a community leader in Edmonton. He served in senior posts with several community organizations, including as president of the Edmonton Museum of the Arts and the Canadian Club of Edmonton, and as a member of the University of Alberta Senate. The former Wells Pavilion at the University of Alberta Hospital was named in his honour. Character Defining Elements The building's Arts and Crafts style is typified by its: - form, scale and massing; - clinker brick detailing on main floor; - horizontal wood-lapped siding; - gable roof and dormers with cedar roof shingles; - exposed rafters and brackets under eaves; - multi-pane wood sash casement windows, including multiple dormer, gable and living room windows with vertical mullions;

- separate coach house with matching brick and wood façade, cross gable roof and window panes.
