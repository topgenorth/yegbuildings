JOHN McNEILL RESIDENCE
11217 - 97 STREET
Description of Historic Place The John McNeill Residence is a large, two and one-half-storey, twotone brick building with intersecting gables and offset front porch and balcony. Built on a city lot in the mature Alberta Avenue neighbourhood fronting onto 97th Street, it is located on one of the principal access routes to Edmonton's downtown. Heritage Value Important for its association with John McNeil, a prominent Edmonton entrepreneur, the John McNeill residence is notable for its Victorian design influences. The house, built circa 1907, is significant for its association with one of Edmonton's most successful transportation entrepreneurs, John McNeill, who lived in the house from 1910 to 1914. Shortly after arriving from Scotland in 1910, John McNeill bought a small company called Twin City Transfer and, typical of the entrepreneurial spirit of the times, successfully expanded the business to become the largest transportation company in Alberta. In addition to busses and his involvement with the first airstrip, he established the first taxi business in Edmonton, Twin City Taxi 1912, and Edmonton's first private ambulance service. An eclectic style with Victorian / Queen Anne influences, the McNeill house is significant for its notable combination of architectural elements, such as the use of colourful orange and buff brick to differentiate

between architectural detail and main walls, the hip roof with intersecting gables, the covered porch and balcony and the roof level widows walk. Character Defining Elements The character defining elements as expressed in the form, massing, and materials and the eclectic Victorian design such as: - the hip roof with cross gables and gable extensions with return eaves and widows walk; - the orange and buff brick with coloured mortar joints; - timber front door;
