LAMBTON BLOCK
10135 - 97 STREET

Description of Historic Place
The Lambton Block is a three-storey
Edwardian-era brick building that
sits on an irregular-shaped lot, at
the corner of 110 Avenue and
97th Street, in proximity to the
Royal Alexandra Hospital and on a
prominent street at the northern
end of the Boyle McCauley District.
Heritage Value
The Lambton Block is valued for its
association with its original owner,
John Robert Boyle. Boyle was wellknown as a member of Edmonton’s
first city council, a Member of the
Alberta Legislative Assembly, a
minister of several different
portfolios and Attorney General.
In 1924 he was appointed to the
Supreme Court of Alberta where
he served until his death in 1936.
The community of Boyle, in
Edmonton, was named in his
honour.
The building is also significant for
its association with its designer
Roland W. Lines who was a noted
architect in Edmonton although he
only practiced there for nine years.
His architectural designs include
buildings such as the Canada
Permanent Building, the Union
Bank and the original Royal
Alexandra Hospital. Trained in
Britain, Lines moved to Edmonton
in 1906, as the western economic
boom was beginning and later
became president of the Alberta
Association of Architects in 1913.
Lines was killed in action overseas
in 1916 during WWI.

The Lambton Block is significant in
its area for its architecture and
landmark value. Built during the
Edwardian era, when construction
was booming in Edmonton, this
unusually shaped building was
designed with Classical Revival
elements, which were part of a
common design vocabulary at the
time. Its unusual shape is dictated
by the shape of its lot and makes it
immediately recognizable while the
distinct chamfered corner increases
its presence on the street.
The significance also derives from
its association with the development
of the McCauley community, one
of Edmonton’s oldest settled
neighbourhoods. The area was
named after Matthew McCauley,
the City of Edmonton’s first mayor.
It emerged as a financial, business
and residential district along the axis
of an important street leading into
the downtown, one of only a few
crossings of the Canadian National
Railway tracks, which separated the
downtown from the northerly
communities.

expressed in character defining
elements such as:
- location on an unusually shaped,
prominent corner lot;
- form, scale and massing;
- brick construction;

windows, paired on the
97th Street façade, six-over-one
on ground floor;

the first and third floor windows;
