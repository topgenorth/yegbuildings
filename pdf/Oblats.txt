OBLATS MAISON
PROVINCIALE
9916 - 110 STREET
Description of Historic Place
The Oblats Maison Provinciale is an
L-shaped three and a half storey brick
building with a cupola. Built in 1935,
it occupies one and a half city lots in
the district of Oliver in central
Edmonton next to St. Joachim
Church.
Heritage Value
The Oblats Maison Provinciale is
significant for its association with the
Les Peres Oblats de Marie Immaculée
Territoires de Nord Ouest, the first
Catholic missionaries in the Canadian
West. It served as their headquarters
for the Ecclesiastical Province of
Alberta and Saskatchewan. Built in
1935 it provided space for the offices
and administrative functions, and
residential quarters for the priests
and administrators connected with
the headquarter functions of the
Ecclesiastical Province of Alberta and
Saskatchewan. It was in continuous
use for this purpose until 1997. While
its renaissance revival architectural
influences are restrained, it represents
a good example of the style in
Alberta.
The Oblats Maison Provinciale is also
significant as it served as the rectory
for St. Joachim parish, the first Roman
Catholic parish in Edmonton. The
Parish of St. Joachim rectory provided
the administrative home for the
parish, and a residence for the Oblats
who served the parish.
The Oblats Maison Provinciale is a
local landmark and one of a number
of buildings that formed part of the
area known as the “Mission Block”.

Built on land acquired from the
Hudson Bay Company in 1886, the
mission’s location, near central
Edmonton, was chosen for its
proximity to Edmonton’s emerging
francophone population. The
principal buildings of the Mission
Block, the Oblats Maison Provinciale,
the St. Joachim Church, St. Joachim
Rectory and the Convent of the
Faithful Companions of Jesus
manifested a substantial religious
presence in the district of Oliver in
downtown Edmonton. St. Joachim’s
Church and the Oblats Maison
Provinciale are the only surviving
buildings of the Mission Block.
