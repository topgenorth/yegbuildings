HULL BLOCK
10601-10607 - 97 STREET

Description of Historic Place
The Hull Block consists of a threestorey Edwardian-era brick mixeduse block on a prominent corner
location on an arterial street that
links the historic McCauley
community with the historic
downtown Boyle community.
Heritage Value
The Hull Block is significant because
of its association with the notable
Calgary entrepreneur William Roper
Hull who came to Canada in 1873.
He became a prominent Calgary
civic leader and constructed many
buildings including the Grain
Exchange, the Alberta Block, the
Albion Hall, the Opera House and
his own mansion. The Hull Block is
the only known building that he
constructed in Edmonton.
The building is an excellent example
of an Edwardian era combination
commercial and residential block,
using red brick with pressed-metal
and cast stone features on the two
corner façades with white lime brick
on the rear façades. The building
design reflects the influence of the
Edwardian era with a tripartite facade
arrangement and tall glazed
storefronts for commercial uses. The
building has value to the City as the
most prominent landmark in the
community, marked by a tall
flagpole. The building has remained
a prominent landmark to this day.
The significance also derives from
its association with the development
of the McCauley community, one

of Edmonton’s oldest settled
neighbourhoods. The area was
named after Matthew McCauley,
the City of Edmonton’s first mayor.
It emerged as a financial, business
and residential district along the axis
of an important street access into
the downtown. The significance of
locating on this street is that it was
one of only a few crossings of the
Canadian National Railway tracks,
which separated the downtown from
the northerly communities.
Character Defining Elements
The Edwardian-era architecture
of the building is expressed in
character defining elements
such as:
- prominent corner location;
- form, scale and massing;
- red clay brick façade construction
with cast stone trims, accents,
decorative balls capping the
parapet pilasters, and the building
name pediments on the two
corner façades;
- white, lime brick construction of
the secondary façades;

- tall, main floor, wood storefronts
with recessed entrances, large
display windows and transparent
bulkhead panels that allow natural
light into the basement;
- two rows of regularly spaced,
wood double-hung windows at
the second and third floor levels
in the two corner façades;
- upper pressed-metal cornice that
extends the full width of the two
corner façades and the lower
pressed metal cornices that define
the storefronts;
- pressed-metal peaked pediment
over the main floor entrance doors;
- 11m flagpole.
