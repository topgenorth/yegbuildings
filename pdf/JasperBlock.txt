JASPER BLOCK
10514-10520
JASPER AVENUE

Description of Historic Place
The Jasper Block consists of a threestorey Edwardian-era mixed-use brick
building on the north side of
Jasper Avenue in central downtown
Edmonton
Heritage Value
The Jasper Block is significant for its
architecture, being one of the last
remaining turn of the century
(twentieth) buildings left on
downtown Jasper Avenue and is a
visual link to the City’s early and
rapid development. The building’s
architectural form and traditional
high glazed store frontages is typical
of many early Edmonton Edwardianera combined commercial and
residential development.
Also significant is its association with
John Kelly, one of Edmonton’s early
typical successful businessmen who
came from mixed professional
backgrounds and found success in
real estate. Starting as a blacksmith
in Edmonton in 1902, but moved
into real estate he developed and
built commercial buildings, of which
a few still remain as significant
historic resources in the City.
There is also significance associated
with the building’s architect, Hopkins
and Wright who were responsible
for the design of other early
commercial buildings.
