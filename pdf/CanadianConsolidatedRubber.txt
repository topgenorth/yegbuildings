CANADIAN
CONSOLIDATED
RUBBER COMPANY
WAREHOUSE
10249 - 104 STREET

Description of Historic Place
The Canadian Consolidated Rubber
Company building is a rectangular,
red brick, five and one-half storey
commercial warehouse located on
the 104th Street in Edmonton’s
historic warehouse district.
Heritage Value
The Canadian Consolidated Rubber
building is architecturally significant
as a representative example of a
commercial warehouse building that
characterized Edmonton’s growth
during the pre-WWI economic
boom. Built in 1913 on the original
foundation of the Kerr Building,
which was destroyed by fire in 1912
with the loss of three lives, the
Canadian Consolidated Rubber
Company building incorporated the
most up to date fire proofing
technology of the day.
The historical significance of the
building lies in its long association
with The Canadian Consolidated
Rubber Company, which owned and
occupied the building from 1913 to
1935 as representative of similar
companies active in the warehouse
district and its continued use as a
warehouse well into the 1970s.

Character Defining Elements
The colour, height, massing, texture,
and number of detail elements of
the building relates positively to the
other buildings in the warehouse
district making it an important
contributor to the architectural and
historical character of the area.
The commercial warehouse
architecture of the Canadian
Consolidated Rubber Building is
expressed in character defining
elements such as:
- the original 1913 west façade
including, full height pilasters
capped with cast stone features,
brick corbelling, dentils and
parapet cornice;

- window treatment at the centrally
located staircase on the west
façade;

frontispiece with cornice,
projecting brick detailing and brick
brackets and cornice above
doorway;
