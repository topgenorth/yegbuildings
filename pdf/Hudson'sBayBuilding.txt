10230 - JASPER AVENUE
Description of Historic Place
The Hudson’s Bay Company
Department Store is a three-storey
Tyndall stone and black granite
commercial building occupying an
entire block-face on Jasper Avenue in
downtown Edmonton.
Heritage Value
The Hudson’s Bay Company
Department Store is significant
because of its association with the
Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC), which
played an essential role in the early
development of Edmonton. Having
been established as an HBC fort,
Edmonton’s growth was integrally
linked to the growth of the company.
The 1939 building’s large size
reflected the company’s later retail
growth and its strong presence in
the city's downtown until the store
was closed in 1984. The HBC has also
always had a store on this site prior
to its move in 1984.
The HBC Department Store is also
significant because it is a rare and
excellent surviving example of the
Moderne style of architecture in
Edmonton. Founded on smooth,
clean and simple lines, the style paid
tribute to the emerging machine age,
which reflected optimism for the
future. The design of the store was
meant not only to herald in the new
age of technology, but also to ride
the wave of success associated with
the new style and the economic
recovery of the late 1930s and 1940s
which fostered it.
The HBC Department Store is also
significant for its association with the

Winnipeg architectural firm of Moody
& Moore, formed in 1936, which
was among the first western Canadian
firms to introduce the International
Style to the Prairies. They designed
the HBC Stores (both new buildings
and additions) in Edmonton,
Saskatoon, Regina, Winnipeg and
elsewhere.
The Hudson’s Bay Company
Department Store is valued as a
landmark along Jasper Avenue. The
former building occupies an entire
block-face with minimal setback,
sparsely articulated walls and little
fenestration above the ground floor,
which contribute to the building’s
imposing appearance, despite its low
horizontal massing. The large scale
and prominent carvings on the
building ornament the exterior and
contribute to its monumental scale
and presence.
The Hudson’s Bay Company
Department Store is also significant
because of its association with
architects Kelvin C. Stanley &
Company, who designed the north
addition in 1955. Stanley was
recognized for his prominent modern
designs in Edmonton, including the
1957 Edmonton City Hall. He later
became Director of Structures for
Expo 67 and Chief Architect for the

federal Department of Public Works
in Ottawa.
