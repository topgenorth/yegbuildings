SARAH McLELLAN
RESIDENCE
11135 - 84 AVENUE
Description of Historic Place
The Sarah McLellan Residence is a
two and a half-storey large
Four-square house with an open
veranda. It is located in the Garneau
subdivision in close proximity to
the University of Alberta in the City
of Edmonton.
Heritage Value
The house is historically significant
for the role it played in the evolution
of the character of housing in the
Garneau subdivision. Built in 1913,
the design and scale of the house,
illustrates the economic and social
expectations of those who
speculated in property in Garneau
after the new University of Alberta
was established in 1907. The
Sarah McLellan Residence is a
representative example of a
vernacular prairie Four-square house.
Its balloon frame construction and
craftsmanship, which has retained
a high degree of integrity, exhibits
many features of Edwardian era
residential style.
The house has a significant
association with WWI. Its owner,
Sarah McLellan, opened the house
as a nurses’ residence (1916 –1919),
for the Strathcona Military Hospital,
which later became the University
of Alberta Hospital. Since the 1920s,
the varied occupational use of the
Sarah McLellan Residence, as a
private residence, student
accommodation, student fraternity,
and a bed and breakfast, illustrates
the traditional special relationship
of Garneau housing to the University.
