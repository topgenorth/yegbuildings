UNION BANK OF
CANADA BUILDING
10053 - JASPER AVENUE
Description of Historic Place
The Union Bank Building is a three
storey rectangular brick and
limestone faced building with an
ornate street façade. It is located on
the south side of Jasper Avenue
facing 100A Street in the heart of
downtown Edmonton.
Heritage Value
The Union Bank Building is significant
for the role it played in the banking
and investment history of Edmonton
for over 69 years. As the only
remaining bank building of seven
built before WWI, it demonstrates
the presence of eastern Canadian
banks on Jasper Avenue at that time.
Its construction in 1910 reflected
the expanding needs of the Union
Bank’s Edmonton branch, during
the period of Edmonton’s economic
boom. The Union Bank Building has
shown a remarkable continuity of
ownership and occupancy by
financial institutions. Purchased in
1928 by Winnipeg’s James
Richardson and Sons Ltd., it served
as an Edmonton base for their grain
trading and stockbroking business,
and was then occupied from 1969
by the North-West Trust Company,
which owned the building from
1979 to 1982. The Union Bank
Building is significant as the location
of a variety of businesses that
occupied offices in the building over
several decades, including the
Cunnard Steamship Co. Ltd.
Character Defining Elements
The Union Bank Building
demonstrates the sophisticated vision

of its architect, the British–trained
Roland Lines (1876–1916) who
designed several other distinctive
Edmonton buildings, including the
Alex Taylor School (1908),
Strathcona Collegiate Institute
(1909), and the nearby Canadian
Permanent Building (1910) on Jasper
Avenue. The Union Bank Building is
significant for its solid imposing street
façade with classical elements
inspired by the Italian Renaissance,
most notably, the rusticated ground
floor, giant order pilasters and openbed pediments with oversize
keystones above the second floor
windows. The central entrance
represented an innovation in
functional design at the time,
whereby the bank entrance also
served upstairs offices and third floor
living quarters for bank employees.
The Union Bank Building has
acquired landmark value due to its
position at the south end of
100A Street and because of the high
visibility of its exposed party wall
above a pedestrian plaza on the
east side as one travels west on
Jasper Avenue.
