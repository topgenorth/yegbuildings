GEORGE DURRAND
RESIDENCE
10417 - SASKATCHEWAN
DRIVE
Description of Historic Place
The George Durrand Residence is a
two and one half storey brick
dwelling built in an Edwardian style.
It is located on the south side of
Saskatchewan Drive on the south
escarpment of the North
Saskatchewan River in Edmonton,
facing north across the North
Saskatchewan River Valley to the
historical city core.
Heritage Value
The George Durrand Residence is
valued for its association with wellrecognized Edmontonians, the
Durrand family, who were
representative of the type of
entrepreneurial and professional
families that began to populate the
city of Strathcona, early in the
twentieth century. Not only
representative of a prosperous
economic class, the family is also
noted for its contracting business,
which was responsible for the
construction of this house among
others and was well known in historic
Edmonton and Strathcona.
The George Durrand Residence is
important to the understanding of
the growth, development, and socioeconomic values associated with
Strathcona prior to WWI. A
neighbourhood of affluent uppermiddle class citizens, the social
aspirations of many of its prominent
residents is reflected in strong, formal
and stylish architecture. The Durrand
Residence is a prominent Edwardian
structure that implies stature, grace

and civility through its neoclassical
building elements and strong
symmetry. It is part of a significant
grouping of houses along
Saskatchewan Drive.
The economic climate until 1913,
when the George Durrand Residence
was built, was generally optimistic,
heightened locally by the
amalgamation of the cities of
Edmonton and Strathcona in1912
and the construction of the High
Level Bridge in 1911. This confidence
was reflected both in the architecture
and in the active business and social
communities of the time. The
generous proportions of this house’s
interior reception spaces indicate an
associated value with formal
entertaining among the social and
business elite of the affluent
Strathcona and Edmonton
communities.
The house was later home to Harold
Gould Macdonald, a noted
Edmontonian and founder of the
H.G. MacDonald Company of
contractors that has grown into the
well-recognized firm of Christensen
and Macdonald, still active to this
day. He lived in the house until 1923.
