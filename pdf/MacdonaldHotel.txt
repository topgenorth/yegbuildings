MacDONALD
HOTEL
10065 - 100 STREET
Description of Historic Place
The Macdonald Hotel, built in the
derivative Canadian château style of the
grand railway hotels, is one of Edmonton’s
foremost symbolic and visual landmarks.
Fronting on 100 Street and McDougall
Hill adjacent to Frank Oliver Memorial
Park in Edmonton’s downtown core, it’s
strategically situated, L-shape form and
seven-storey Indiana limestone façades
present a dignified and solid presence
overlooking Edmonton’s North
Saskatchewan River valley.
Heritage Value
Built in 1915 and named after Sir John
A. MacDonald, the “Mac”, as it has
become affectionately known, is
significant for its strong association with
Edmontonians social, cultural and political
history as exemplified by the intense civic
rancour when it closed its doors in 1983
and the protracted negotiations that led
to its careful restoration and
extraordinarily well received public
reopening celebration in May of 1991.
The centrepiece for royal visits,
graduations, family birthdays, and a wide
range of occasions in between, the “Mac”
continues to be a major contributor to
Edmonton’s collective memory.
The Macdonald is architecturally
significant as an expression of the
Canadian châteaux style, the preferred
style for the transcontinental railway
hotels, which is derived from the French
Renaissance Châteaux. Characterized by
high-pitched dormered roofs and inspired
by French Renaissance architectural
elements, the Macdonald Hotel was
designed for the Grand Trunk Railway by
architects Ross and MacFarlane, who also
designed the Fort Garry Hotel and the
Château Laurier.

Rooted in Canadian history through its
origins as one of two Chateau style railway
hotels built by the Grand Trunk Pacific
Railway and later owned by both the
Canadian National Railway and the
Canadian Pacific Hotels, the Macdonald
Hotel symbolizes Edmonton’s participation
in the historic national transcontinental
railway initiative.
The Macdonald Hotel’s substantial visual
landmark status can be attributed to its
distinctive architecture and prominent
location overlooking the North
Saskatchewan River escarpment.
