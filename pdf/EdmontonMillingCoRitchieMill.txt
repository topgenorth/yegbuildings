Description of Historic Place
The Ritchie Mill is a visually
prominent structure consisting of
several building segments that are
between two and four storeys in
height and is located on the south
escarpment of the North
Saskatchewan River valley, facing
across the North Saskatchewan River
to the historical Edmonton core.
Heritage Value
Constructed in 1892 and the oldest
surviving flour mill in the Province,
the Ritchie Mill is significant because
of its association with the early
agricultural and industrial
development of Alberta. It is
associated with early technical
innovation, using steam powered,
steel rollers instead of the traditional
stone wheels that became pitted
when grinding hard prairie wheat.
The Ritchie Mill is also significant
because of its association with
industrial and agricultural
development in an urban setting
and with the development of the
Strathcona community, one of south
Edmonton’s oldest settled
neighbourhoods, dating from the
arrival of the Calgary and Edmonton
railway in 1892, which terminated
at the North Saskatchewan River
Valley. The Ritchie Mill was located

at the ‘End of Steel’ to take
advantage of the rail link with the
southern part of the Province.
Elevators were added in 1895 and
1902 and the building functioned
as a flour mill until 1948.
The Ritchie Mill is also significant
because of its association with
Robert Ritchie who arrived in
Strathcona in 1892. Within a year
he had built and began operating
the flour mill and added elevators
in 1895 and 1905. Ritchie also
served in local politics as alderman,
school trustee, justice of the peace
and in 1906 as mayor of
Strathcona.
The Ritchie Mill is also significant
as a prominent visual landmark on
the south edge of the North
Saskatchewan River Valley. Its tall
profile was readily visible from
Edmonton across the river valley
and as a landmark signified the
end of the Calgary and Edmonton
railway line in Strathcona.

Character Defining Elements
The early industrial architecture of the
building is expressed in characterdefining elements such as:
- form, scale and massing;
- location at ‘End of Steel’ on the
south escarpment of the
Saskatchewan River Valley;
- the configuration of the original
1892-93 three-storey rectangular
mill building with a regular pattern
of fenestration at all floors on both
the east and west elevations;
- the configuration of the south fourstorey elevator with no windows
and a solid appearance on the west
elevation as well as a one storey
former unloading and weighing
station on the east side;
- the configuration of the north,
partial brick-construction, fourstorey building;
- the configuration of the west twostorey addition, perpendicular to
the original mill building;
- the various configurations of gable
and hip roofs.
