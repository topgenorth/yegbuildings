ROY GEROLAMY RESIDENCE
9823 - 91 AVENUE
Description of Historic Place The Roy Gerolamy Residence consists of a two-storey, wood-frame residential building in a mid-block location on a residential street in the historic Strathcona neighbourhood. Heritage Value The 1913 Roy Gerolamy Residence is significant because of its architecture, which is an excellent example, with superior design attributes, of the Four-square style, which became popular during the Edwardian Era. Derived from American Colonial and Classical Revival architecture, it was typified by the use of symmetry and classical detailing. The Roy Gerolamy Residence is also significant because of its association with the development of the Strathcona community, one of south Edmonton's oldest settled neighbourhoods dating from the arrival of the railway in 1892, and a separate city until amalgamation with Edmonton in 1912. Character Defining Elements The Four-square architecture of the Roy Gerolamy Residence is expressed in character defining elements such as: - form, scale and massing; - hipped-roof configurations on the main house and the upper open porch, with bellcast eaves; - two exterior brick chimneys that are expressed on the east and west elevations;

- asymmetrically-located, open front porch with second floor roofed balcony, both with solid handrails, and triple corner wood support posts; - upper floor bay window in the front façade; - lower floor projecting square bay window in the west façade with hipped roof; - wood double-hung windows with four-pane arched-mullions in the upper sashes, tall lower sashes and fixed sash windows in the lower floor with similar arched-mullion pane configuration; - upper cedar shingle cladding with bellcast flare and lower cedar clapboard siding, separated by a continuous horizontal wood belly band; - wood soffits with decorative brackets on all upper eaves.
