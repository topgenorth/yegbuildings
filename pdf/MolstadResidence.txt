MOLSTAD
RESIDENCE
9633 - 95 AVENUE
Description of Historic Place
Molstad House is large two and a
half storey building with hip roof
located on a 95th Avenue corner lot,
once known as Molstad Avenue, in
the centre of the Bonnie Doon
neighbourhood.
Heritage Value
The Molstad House is significant for
its association with entrepreneurship
and residential development in
Edmonton’s pre-WWI economic
boom. Built for Edward and Addie
Molstad in 1912, it represents part
of a larger estate which occupied
five lots and once included grounds
and gardens, fountains, circular drive,
carriage house, and servants
quarters. Mr. Molstad established
the Fort George and Fraser Valley
Land Company and Molstad and
Company Ltd., one of Edmonton’s
oldest and largest real estate
companies.
The property has historical
significance to the community of
Bonnie Doon, as both the Molstads
were known for the their civic
contributions to the neighbourhood.
The Moldstad House symbolises the
contribution of the early business
sector to community and civic pride
in Edmonton. The Molstad House
has a special association with the
community because Mr. Molstad
made two lots available for a
neighbourhood skating rink in winter
and tennis courts in summer, and
Mrs. Molstad, hosted an annual
children’s Christmas party.

A cosmetologist and painter,
Addie Molstad lived in the house
until 1982.
The house is an impressive example
of an elaborate urban Four-square
design. The Molstad House is larger
and of higher quality of design and
materials than most, which is clearly
exemplified by such elements as the
tetra style two-storey portico with
gable roof and the use of brick
cladding and cedar shingles for the
exterior walls.
The Molstad House is significant as
a landmark on a corner location at
the centre of the neighbourhood
and provides a structural link to
local history.
