RICHARD FOOTE
RESIDENCE
9704 - 106 STREET
Description of Historic Place
The Foote Residence is a two and a
half storey brick-clad Edwardian-era
version of a Four-square building.
It is located on the north side of
97 Avenue on 106 Street, just to the
east of the grounds of the Alberta
Legislature.
Heritage Value
The Foote Residence is valued for its
association with an early Edmonton
builder and architect, Richard E.
Foote. Foote was representative of
many people important in the early
era of the construction industry. With
Nathaniel Purcell, he owned a
substantial contracting business and
eventually designed and built
important structures such as
Edmonton's first Civic Block. He
served on City Council and worked
for the City Architect's Department
later in his life. The house was his
residence in 1907, and then from
1911 until 1916.
The Foote Residence is also
significant as an excellent elaborate
example of the Four-square style,
which became popular during the
Edwardian era. Derived from
American Colonial and Classical
Revival architecture, it was typified
by the use of symmetry and classical
detailing.
The Foote Residence is also
significant as a symbol of the social
change occurring in Edmonton after
the turn of the century. The
residence's grand proportions and
attention to detail befits the
entrepreneurial and professional

classes, which emerged rapidly after
the city was confirmed as Provincial
Capital in 1906. It's location, facing
the river flats where working-class
neighbourhoods were established
previous to its construction, provided
an anchor to the up-scale
neighbourhood that developed in
proximity to the nearby Legislature
grounds.
The Foote Residence is also
significant for some of its tenants,
who illustrate the range of middle
class and professional individuals
who shaped Edmonton in the years
following the rapid economic and
political change of the period
immediately after 1900. They
included one of the earliest
important scientists and civil servants
in Alberta, Dr. Daniel G. Revell,
Provincial bacteriologist, who resided
here from 1908 to 1910 and was
involved in teaching, research,
criminal investigations and medical
practice and study throughout his
life. John McLaren, business manager
for the Edmonton Journal, lived here
in 1917, and is another such
prominent individual associated with
this aspect of community growth.
